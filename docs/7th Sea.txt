7th Sea RnK support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a special support for RnK mechanics. The base form is '5k2', it shows
all kept dice and their sum. Exploded dice are shown as result numbers (23 for
10+10+3, for example). A static modifier may be applied to the total sum using
'5k2+2' or '5k2-2'. '-' prefix disables explosion of 10's, '+' prefix enables
printing of unkept dice. If you want to disable explosion and to print unkept
dice, you can use '-5kk2' ('5kk2' is identical to '+5k2'). Attempts to roll
and/or keep more than 10 dice are resolved according to Player's Guide,
wrapping excess dice from unkept to kept and from kept to the static modifier.
