Shadowrun 4th ed. support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In SR4 you roll a number of d6 (this number is called a dice pool) and count
how many dice show 5 or 6, the more the better (SR4 p.54-55). You also need to
count 1's, because if half or more of the dice show 1, you have a *glitch*
(some bad game effect). Because you don't need to sum roll results, roll dice
other than d6 or add some fixed modifiers, SR4 dicer can (and should) be
simpler and easier to use. So you just say 10#sd (where 10 is your dice pool)
and bot will show the total hits number and/or a glitch message.
Also you can declare the use of Edge before a roll (SR4 p.67) to use the Rule
of Six (SR4, p.56), which means rerolling all 6's, potentially increasing the
total hits number. This mode is used by saying 10#sdx (x stands for 'eXploding
dice').

The current version of Shadowrun code will log all the rolled dice values
(with the DEBUG level), to check the algorithm and for curious players.  This
may be removed in future versions.
